"On-demand ssh tunnelling with a client-server architecture."

---------
Overview:
---------
ssh-tunneld is a daemon process which listens on tcp/1081 (by default)
for connections from ssh-tunnelc (the client). When a client requests
an SSH tunnel, the ssh-tunneld process will open an SSH connection to
the host you configured, using the "-D" option for SOCKS5 dynamic
forwarding. It then tells the client to go ahead and use the connection.

The client is designed to be used as the "ProxyCommand" for an SSH session
(see "man ssh_config" for details). It requests a tunnel from ssh-tunneld,
then establishes its own connection using the netcat ("nc") program to
connect through the newly created SOCKS5 proxy. When the SSH session ends,
ssh-tunnelc tells the ssh-tunneld that it is done.

ssh-tunneld keeps a count of the connected clients. When this count is > 0,
the same "ssh -D" tunnel is used for all clients. If the count drops to 0,
the tunnel is closed (SIGTERM is sent to the ssh process), and a
subsequent client connect would result in a new tunnel being established.

-------------
Requirements:
-------------
 1. public key (or other passwordless) access to the host being used as the
    remote end of the dynamic forwarding. This can be done with passwordless
	keys (not recommended) or keys which are available in an ssh-agent that
	is in the environment of ssh-tunneld.

 2. netcat-openbsd (the OpenBSD version of netcat, rather than
    netcat-traditional). This is required for the "-x" and "-X"
	(SOCKS proxy) options to the "nc" program to work.

 3. (Dynamic) SSH forwarding enabled on the proxy host (remote host of the
    "ssh -D" command). Note this also requires SSH Protocol version 2.
