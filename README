"On-demand SSH tunnelling with a client-server architecture."

---------
Overview:
---------
ssh-tunneld is a daemon process which listens on tcp/1081 (by default)
for connections from ssh-tunnelc (the client). When a client requests
an SSH tunnel, the ssh-tunneld process will open an SSH connection to
the host you configured, using the "-D" option for SOCKS5 dynamic
forwarding. It then tells the client to go ahead and use the connection.

The client is designed to be used as the "ProxyCommand" for an SSH session
(see "man ssh_config" for details). It requests a tunnel from ssh-tunneld,
then establishes its own connection using the netcat ("nc") program to
connect through the newly created SOCKS5 proxy. When the SSH session ends,
ssh-tunnelc tells the ssh-tunneld that it is done.

ssh-tunneld keeps a count of the connected clients. When this count is > 0,
the same "ssh -D" tunnel is used for all clients. If the count drops to 0,
the tunnel is closed (SIGTERM is sent to the ssh process), and a
subsequent client connect would result in a new tunnel being established.

-------------
Requirements:
-------------
 1. public key (or other passwordless) access to the host being used as the
    remote end of the dynamic forwarding. This can be done with passwordless
    keys (not recommended) or keys which are available in an ssh-agent that
    is in the environment of ssh-tunneld.

 2. netcat-openbsd (the OpenBSD version of netcat, rather than
    netcat-traditional). This is required for the "-x" and "-X"
    (SOCKS proxy) options to the "nc" program to work.

 3. (Dynamic) SSH forwarding enabled on the proxy host (remote host of the
    "ssh -D" command). Note this also requires SSH Protocol version 2.

------
Usage:
------
 1. Type 'make' to build the client (ssh-tunnelc) and server (ssh-tunneld) in
    their respective directories. This works with either BSD Make or GNU Make.
 
 2. Copy the binaries ssh-tunnelc/ssh-tunnelc and ssh-tunneld/ssh-tunneld to
    somewhere in your $PATH.

 3. Ensure that the ssh-agent has an unlocked copy of the private key for the
    host you want to tunnel through (or use passwordless keys; not recommended).

 4. Start the ssh-tunneld. Typing ssh-tunneld will show usage information.
    At the minimum, you need to provide the hostname to connect to when
    setting up dynamic port forwarding:
    ssh-tunneld somehost.somedomain.tld
 
 5. Add an entry in $HOME/.ssh/config for the host you want to connect to
    through the tunnel. Include the following command:
    ProxyCommand ssh-tunnelc %h %p
    (You can specify additional options; typing ssh-tunnelc will print usage).

 6. Use ssh to connect to the host you created the above entry for. ssh will
    launch ssh-tunnelc, which will communicate with ssh-tunneld. ssh-tunneld
    will create a tunnel, which ssh-tunnelc will use (with the help of nc)
    for the ssh connection you're trying to start. When you're done, logout
    as normal, and ssh-tunnelc will tell ssh-tunneld to tear down the tunnel
    (unless something else is still using it).

------------
Known Issues
------------

1. Active connection count is incorrect if the client terminates due to 
   receiving SIGKILL. There isn't a lot that can be done about this...
   One option might be some kind of keep-alive approach, but I have no
   plans to implement this any time soon.

Changelog
---------

2012-08-24 Andrew J. Bennieston
    * Ensure that the result of any malloc() or strdup() call is checked

      string

2012-07-30 Andrew J. Bennieston
    * Use (char *) NULL instead of plain NULL to terminate execlp(...);

2012-06-10 Andrew J. Bennieston
    * Better initialisation of variables in ssh-tunneld.c

      command-line options

2012-03-21 Andrew J. Bennieston
    * Split ssh-tunnelc.c across multiple files to improve ease of
      navigation
